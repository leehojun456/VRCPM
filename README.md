VRCPM is a picture manager application for VRChat that allows users to easily view data recorded in photos taken with the VRChat camera. It provides simple photo management features such as organizing photos by date and deleting them. also if you use VRCX then you see metadata info in picture.

* When editing a picture, metadata (e.g., from Photoshop, Lightroom, etc.) may be removed. To retain the metadata, keep the original picture.
